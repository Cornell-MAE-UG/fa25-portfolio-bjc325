## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Benjamin Chin, and I am an aspiring pre-med biomedical engineer at Cornell University. My academic experiences and ambitions stem from a dream of being able to help as many people as I can. I plan to use the problem solving skills that I learn from engineering and apply them to the healthcare field to ensure that I can provide the best aid possible. My overall goal is to be able to further connect the innovations within healthcare equipment and the clinical care itself.
